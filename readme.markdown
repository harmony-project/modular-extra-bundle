# HarmonyModularExtraBundle
This bundle is part of the [Harmony Project](http://harmony-project.io).

HarmonyModularExtraBundle adds additional functionality to the Symfony framework
for projects that support [modular routing](https://github.com/harmony-project/modular-routing).
Functionality provided by this bundle also works in projects that don't use
modular routing to encourage the use of modules for a wider range of applications.

## Installation
